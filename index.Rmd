# **Assessment Tracker**

Homeworks, Quizzes, and Midterms are sorted by the date assigned below. 

You can download the homework assignments in zipped folders using the links below. For the homework assignments, unzip the folder, open the RMD file, complete the assignment, knit to PDF, and submit PDF to Gradescope. 

For the quizzes, you will go to Canvas, and enter the access code given to you during class. The quiz must be completed by the end of class and the amount of time you have will vary based off the length of the quiz. 

The midterms will be taken in Gradescope on the dates listed. You will have the entire class period to complete each Midterm. Midterms are expected to be completed by the end of class.

# **Extra Credit Assignment**

This will be announced in class on November 7 and due by November 24 at 5PM.

The movie Marvels will be released in theaters on November 10. You will be predicting the accumulated domestic box office as it is recorded or estimated by the website <https://www.boxofficemojo.com/> on December 8. 

Reward for everyone: Every student who participates in this extra credit assignment will get a 1% bump to their final grades after curving. This assumes you followed all instructions and made a legitimate effort to conduct your an analysis to defend your prediction. If you provide a prediction but don't have analysis or argument that agrees with that prediction, I will consider this a violation of the Honor Code. 

Reward for some: The 5 teams with the most accurate prediction, measured based off the absolute value, will receive an additional 0.5% bump to their final grades after curving. This leads to a 1.5% total curve. This assumes you followed all instructions and made a legitimate effort to conduct your analysis to defend your prediction. If you are accurate, but your prediction comes from either a guess or is not defended based off your work, you will not be eligible for any extra credit including the 1% and the 0.5% bonus. In case of a tie where 2 or more teams achieve the exact same accuracy, the team (all group members) that submits their prediction the earliest will rank higher. 

To complete this, you will need to download the RMD template [here](https://github.com/SuperMarioGiacomazzo/STOR455_WEBSITE/raw/main/Homework/ExtraCredit.zip) and knit the completed document to a PDF. In this RMD template, you will need to enter a team name  and list the name and PID of each member of your team. You will also need to edit the RMD file to enter your prediction (one number only). Then, you will need to provide the code you wrote, show output of the data you used, show all the methods/models you considered to get to this prediction. Finally, in 1 paragraph, I would like you to summarize the work you did that led to the exact prediction you made. In this paragraph, I want to know why you think your actual prediction is the "best" or "most accurate".  

For this extra credit assignment, you may work in a team of at most 6 people. Each student must individually submit a completed PDF from the RMD template provided on time to get the extra credit. The due date for this submission is November 24 at 5PM. No late submissions will be considered at all. The time that your team submits will be based off the group member who submits last so make sure when you complete the assignment that all members of your team submit at relatively the same time on Canvas. This will be important for breaking ties.

I, Mario Giacomazzo, can choose to modify the curve or not give the curve to students who submit the extra credit assignment but fail to follow all of the instructions of the extra credit assignment.
